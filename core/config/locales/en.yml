          Your application requires a 'current_user' method. If you use an
          authentication gem like 'devise', this method is provided for you.
          Your user model should also include the module `Maeku::AuthorMethods`
          to be compatible with `maeku_core`.

          Maeku could not find a user model in the typical location (e.g.
          'app/models/your_user_model.rb'). Before you can use Maeku, you need
          to `include Maeku::AuthorMethods` in your user model. You can do this
          by a) using the '--author_class=YourUserClass' flag, or b) entering
          `include Maeku::AuthorMethods` manually in your user model definition
          and running this generator again with the '--skip_author_methods'
          flag.
