# maeku (前句), a journalling platform

The term *maeku* is used to describe elements of the Japanese collaborative
poetry genre [renga][1]. Specifically, *maeku* refers to a verse where unlikely
words are strung together to evoke a new or surprising image. 

Maeku is a [Ruby on Rails][2]-based journalling platform. Eventually, it will
support multiple users and be extensible with multiple post types. It's inspired
by Tumblr, [Hi.co][3] (defunct), Japanese poetry, and the idea of controlling
your own blog content on the web. 

**Maeku is not ready to be used yet.**
